CSS 458 Final Project: Patient Flow Simulation In Emergency Room (ER)

This project aim to answer the question: What is the most optimal number of examination room to reduce waiting time?

We will simulate a patient flow in an emergency room. Each patient will be randomly assigned with attributes such as
age, gender, race, and insurance status. They will also have an attribute called level of urgency which decides their positions
in the waiting queue.

Each patient will have different arrival times and departure times.
